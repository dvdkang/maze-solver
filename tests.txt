Test Plan: Using the solve function to solve the maze and see if there is a
           path from the start of the maze to the end. In order to get this
           we use 3 different helper functions in our solve file to be
           able to solve the maze.
       1. endchecker: checks to see if the position matches with the
                      position of the end of the maze, if so return true,
                      otherwise return false.
       2. neighbordetermine: checks the neighboring positions and
                             determines whether the position is a valid
                             position to be added to the path.
       3. pathdetermine: makes the 4 neighboring positions and have it run
                         through the neighbordetermine function.

We will test through a couple of mazes to make sure that the solutions are
produced properly and if there is no end then it prints nothing.

Explanation:
The output of every valid maze is given accurate paths that lead to the end
of the maze and the mazes that are null or no start or end is given the
error that it is not a valid maze. All testing results match predicted
results, therefore the program is correct.
